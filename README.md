# IST440W
We have developed a MEWS mobile alert system that will alert clinicians whenever a patient's MEWS score reaches a certain threshold. We used HTML and CSS for our front-end and JavaScript and PHP for our back-end. Our database, which will store patient information, will run on an Apache MySQL server. <br>
